# SellAll
Sell all items in your hand or all items in your inventory with the same type as in your hand
It's really simple: just type **/sell all** if you want to send every block in your inventory that is of the same type as in your hand. type **/sell hand** if you just want to sell the stack if items in your hand.

The plugin will base the prices on what you put in **config.yml**. just add the id and then the price you want to sell it for. Example: `100: 10`

The plugin will do the rest! Players need the `sellall.command` permission to use the /sell command.
